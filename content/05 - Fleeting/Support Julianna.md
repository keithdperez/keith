It sounds like you’re really trying, Keith, and that you’re aware of what matters most to her. Here are a few refined suggestions that might help bridge that gap:

1. **Consistent Acts of Service**: Since her love language is acts of service, focus on doing small, consistent things that make her life easier. This could be household chores, running errands, or taking care of tasks she usually handles. Consistency is key here, as it shows ongoing commitment.

2. **Non-Verbal Presence**: Sometimes, being present doesn’t require words. Engage in activities that she enjoys or needs help with, even if it’s just being there silently. Your physical presence and support during these tasks can make a big difference.

3. **Detailed Feedback**: When she points out what went wrong or how you were not present, ask for specific examples. It can be helpful to understand exactly what she perceives as a lack of presence or a missed mark. This can guide you in making more targeted changes.

4. **Empathy and Validation**: Acknowledge her feelings without trying to fix them immediately. Sometimes, validating her emotions and expressing empathy can help her feel understood. Statements like, "I can see how that would make you feel alone," can go a long way.

5. **Shared Activities**: Engage in activities that require teamwork or collaboration. This can create a sense of partnership and shared effort, which might help her feel more connected to you.

6. **Mindfulness Practices**: Practicing mindfulness together can help both of you stay present and connected. This can be through meditation, yoga, or simply mindful breathing exercises.

Remember, it's not just about the big gestures but the everyday actions that build trust and connection over time. Keep showing up, and over time, your efforts will hopefully begin to resonate with her. You both have a solid foundation; it’s about finding the rhythm that works for both of you.
