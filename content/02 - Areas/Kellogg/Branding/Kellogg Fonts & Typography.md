# Fonts + typography

## Typography for design professionals

  
**Gotham** is our brand’s sans-serif font and a typographic workhorse. It can be used in a variety of ways: for headlines, body copy and captions. It also works well for charts, graphs and displaying data.  
  
**Petrona** is our brand’s serif font. Use Petrona bold italic or Petrona bold for special callouts or accents on your professionally designed pages. Petrona regular is ideal for longer copy.  
  
**Roboto** and **Petrona** are our website fonts. Use these fonts when editing webpages in our template.

### System fonts for general use

Use **Arial** in place of Gotham for all presentations, letters, HTML emails and other materials.  
  
**Georgia** is ideal for longer copy in smaller sizes. Its more balanced construction allows for greater legibility.  
  
Arial and Georgia are default system fonts that come pre-installed on all Mac and Windows operating systems. If you do not have Arial or Georgia on your computer, please email KIS for help.
