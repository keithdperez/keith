# Understanding God's View on Heart and Actions

## God Knows Our Heart

**1 Samuel 16:7** - "But the Lord said to Samuel, 'Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the Lord sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.'"
- God looks beyond external appearances and sees the true nature of our heart.

**Jeremiah 17:10** - "I the Lord search the heart and test the mind, to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his deeds."
- God searches the heart and examines the mind, rewarding each person according to their conduct.

## Actions Revealing the Heart

**Matthew 7:16-20** - "By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them."
- Actions ("fruit") are indicators of the nature of a person’s heart ("tree"). Good actions come from a good heart and vice versa.

**James 2:17-18** - "So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. But someone will say, 'You have faith and I have works.' Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works."
- Genuine faith is evidenced by actions. The heart’s faith is demonstrated through deeds.

## God's Judgment and Deeds

**Revelation 2:2** - "I know your deeds, your hard work and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate wicked people, that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them false."
- Jesus acknowledges the deeds of the church, indicating that their actions are known and seen by Him.

**Revelation 3:15-16** - "I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth."
- Deeds are seen and judged by God, reflecting the state of the believers' commitment.

## Synthesis and Understanding

The Bible presents a nuanced view where both the heart and actions are crucial. God knows the heart and judges based on the true intentions and nature of a person. However, actions are the tangible expressions of what is in the heart. Good deeds, borne out of genuine faith and a pure heart, are seen as evidence of one’s inner condition. Conversely, actions that contradict a professed faith reveal a disconnect between belief and practice.

**Summary:**
- **God knows the heart**: He sees our true intentions, motivations, and the inner nature that others might not see.
- **Actions reveal the heart**: Our deeds are the outward expressions of our inner beliefs and values. They provide evidence of the state of our heart.
- **Judgment by deeds**: In the end, we are accountable for our actions, which reflect our true inner state.

Understanding this dynamic can guide in aligning the heart and actions to live a life that is pleasing to God.
