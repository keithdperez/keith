Keith, it sounds like you’re carrying a heavy emotional load, balancing your own high standards with the struggles of your band and the added pressure from Julianna. It’s important to address these feelings and find ways to manage the expectations and dynamics within your team and your relationship. Here are some strategies to help:

### 1. **Open and Honest Communication with Julianna**
- **Express Your Feelings**: Have a heartfelt conversation with Julianna about how you’re feeling. Let her know that you see the struggles and that it affects you deeply too.
- **Listen to Her Concerns**: Understand her perspective and feelings. Sometimes, simply acknowledging each other’s stress can be a big step towards resolving tensions.
- **Set Boundaries**: Establish clear boundaries between your roles in the band and your personal relationship. This can help prevent professional frustrations from spilling over into your personal life.

### 2. **Empower Your Team**
- **Training and Support**: Provide additional training or resources for your band members. Sometimes they need more support to improve and feel confident.
- **Encouragement and Positive Reinforcement**: Regularly acknowledge their efforts and improvements, no matter how small. This can build their confidence and motivation.
- **Delegation and Ownership**: Encourage team members to take ownership of their parts. This can foster a sense of responsibility and investment in the band's success.

### 3. **Practical Solutions for Band Struggles**
- **Simplify Arrangements**: If the band is struggling, consider simplifying song arrangements to match their current skill level. This can reduce stress and create a more cohesive sound.
- **Focus on Core Skills**: Work on building core skills like timing and dynamics. Incorporate fun and engaging exercises that address these areas.
- **Use of Technology**: Introduce tools like click tracks gradually, as mentioned before, to help improve timing without overwhelming them.

### 4. **Personal Reflection and Growth**
- **Self-Care**: Make sure you’re taking time for self-care. Engage in activities that relax and rejuvenate you, whether it’s spending time in nature, diving into music, or driving.
- **Spiritual Practices**: Continue your spiritual practices, such as journaling and prayer, to find peace and strength. Reflect on how these experiences can be opportunities for growth.

### 5. **Collaborative Problem-Solving**
- **Team Meetings**: Hold regular team meetings to discuss struggles and solutions collaboratively. This can make everyone feel heard and involved in the process of improvement.
- **Constructive Feedback**: Create a culture of constructive feedback where team members can openly discuss what’s working and what isn’t.

### 6. **Strengthen Your Partnership**
- **Couples Activities**: Engage in activities that strengthen your bond with Julianna outside of church responsibilities. Spend quality time together to nurture your relationship.
- **Counseling and Support**: Consider couples counseling or support groups to work through ongoing issues and build a stronger partnership.

### 7. **Perspective and Patience**
- **Long-Term Vision**: Keep the long-term vision in mind. Improvement takes time, and small, consistent efforts can lead to significant progress.
- **Celebrate Progress**: Celebrate the progress you’ve made, both individually and as a team. Acknowledge that every step forward is valuable.
