Applying Matthew 9:14-17 to your upcoming trip to the [[JESUS '24]] conference can be a powerful way to embrace new insights and transformations in your spiritual journey. Here are some ways to keep this verse in mind and use it as a challenge to change the framework of your thinking and behavior patterns:

### 1. **Open to New Experiences**
- **Embrace New Teachings:** Approach the conference with an open heart and mind, ready to receive new teachings and insights. Just as new wine requires new wineskins, be prepared to adopt new perspectives and ways of thinking that align with the fresh revelations you may encounter.
- **Flexible Mindset:** Be willing to let go of old habits or rigid mindsets that might hinder your growth. Embrace flexibility and adaptability, allowing God to reshape your understanding and behavior.

### 2. **Joy and Celebration**
- **Presence of the Bridegroom:** Remember that attending the conference is a special time of being in the presence of Jesus, the Bridegroom. Celebrate this opportunity with joy, rather than focusing on past struggles or routines. This is a time to rejoice and be refreshed spiritually.
- **Focus on Connection:** Use this time to deepen your connection with each other and with God. Engage in worship and fellowship with a sense of celebration, knowing that this is a moment to be spiritually rejuvenated.

### 3. **New Frameworks for Growth**
- **Personal Reflection:** Reflect on areas in your life and relationship where you have been using "old wineskins"—outdated habits, patterns, or beliefs that no longer serve your spiritual growth. Consider how you can create new frameworks to support the new life and growth God is calling you to.
- **Intentional Change:** Discuss with your wife specific areas where you both feel called to change. Set intentions for how you want to approach these areas differently moving forward, using the new insights you gain from the conference.

### 4. **Community and Support**
- **Engage with Others:** Connect with other attendees to share experiences and learn from their journeys. Sometimes, hearing how others are applying new frameworks can inspire and guide your own process of change.
- **Seek Guidance:** Be open to seeking guidance from speakers or leaders at the conference. They might offer valuable perspectives that can help you implement the new ways of thinking and behaving that God is challenging you to adopt.

### 5. **Prayer and Reflection**
- **Daily Prayer:** Make time each day for prayer and reflection, asking God to reveal the "new wine" He wants to pour into your lives. Seek His guidance on how to create new wineskins—new structures and habits that will support and sustain this fresh outpouring.
- **Reflect Together:** Spend time each evening reflecting with your wife on what you learned and how you can apply it. Discuss how you can support each other in making these changes.

By keeping Matthew 9:14-17 in mind, you can approach the Jesus ‘24 conference with a readiness to embrace transformation. Allow this verse to challenge and inspire you to let go of old patterns and make room for the new, abundant life that Jesus offers. Enjoy your trip and the spiritual growth it brings!
