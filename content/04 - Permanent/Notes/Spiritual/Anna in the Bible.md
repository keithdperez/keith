# SUMMARY
Robin Gallaher Branch discusses Anna, a prophetess in the Bible, highlighting her piety, advanced age, and significant role in Luke's narrative.

# IDEAS:
- Anna is one of the Bible’s most unusual women, introduced at the end of the Birth Narrative.
- Anna concludes the sextet of named, pious Israelites surrounding the miraculous births of John and Jesus.
- The purification ritual required a sacrifice of a lamb or two pigeons or two doves.
- Simeon and Anna arrive at the ritual independently, though both seem led by divine direction.
- Simeon praises the Lord while Anna offers thanks; he prophesies, but she is called a prophetess.
- Anna is the New Testament’s only named female prophetess, outranking Simeon in this regard.
- Luke gives Anna’s father’s name, Phanuel, but not her husband’s, and mentions her tribe, Asher.
- Anna evangelizes immediately and selectively—to those “looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.”
- As a prophetess, Anna receives insight into things that normally remain hidden to ordinary people.
- Luke dwells on Anna’s advanced age with ambiguity; she could be 84 or 105 years old.
- Anna’s lifestyle may be seen as eccentric today; she never leaves the Temple, worships night and day.
- Her habits of worship, prayer, and fasting represent a routine, probably one of decades.
- Anna sets her own hours, schedule, route, and routine, listening to God and praying as directed.
- Luke omits mention of her family; perhaps she had outlived her children or had no living family members.
- Her lifestyle of fasting may indicate thinness; her ability to walk around the Temple indicates fitness.
- Anna shows one model of aging in the Biblical text, presented positively without bitterness.
- She may well have become the model for the righteous church widows Paul describes in 1 Timothy 5:5.
- The best representatives of the Old Covenant—Zechariah, Elizabeth, Simeon, and Anna—ably serve as transitions to the New Covenant.
- Anna’s actions affirm Amos 3:7: “Surely the Sovereign Lord does nothing without revealing his plans to his servants the prophets.”
- Luke’s description shows her as well adjusted, engaged in Israel’s life and useful to the Lord.

# INSIGHTS:
- Anna’s advanced age and piety make her a unique figure in Luke’s narrative.
- Her immediate evangelism contrasts with Simeon’s broader prophecy about Jesus’ significance.
- Anna’s lifestyle of constant worship and fasting invigorates rather than exhausts her.
- Luke’s textual silences about Anna’s family and finances highlight her spiritual focus.
- Anna’s recognition of Jesus as the Messiah underscores her prophetic insight.
- Her role as a prophetess emphasizes the importance of women in biblical narratives.
- Anna’s life exemplifies hope and engagement despite advanced age and potential loneliness.
- The pairing of Simeon and Anna highlights different aspects of recognizing Jesus’ significance.
- Her actions align with biblical precedents of fasting and prayer leading to divine insight.
- Anna serves as a bridge between the Old and New Covenants through her prophetic role.
