### Scripture:
#### 1 Corinthians 1
19 For it is written: "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent."
**25 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.**
27 But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty; 28 and the base things of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen, and the things which are not, to bring to nothing the things that are, 29 that no flesh should glory in His presence.

### Observation:
- The serpent deceived the OG human into believing God withheld from him being like him (God made man in His imageâ€¦)
- My foolish words is EXACLY what God will use!!! Christ crucified is not a heady, theological word-finesse. It is the POWER OF GOD in my foolishness.

### Application:
I'm in good company in bringing foolishnessâ€¦ as my brothers as sisters had brought - it is the power of God to save!

### Prayer:
Humble the wise of the world, Lord! Bring the world to their knees. Your foolishness is higher than the glory of man. ðŸ¤¯
God, cause me to become more undignified than this.

Love,
Keith
