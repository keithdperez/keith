## Scripture

- Micah 4:1-2 (NKJV): "Now it shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the Lordâ€™s house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and peoples shall flow to it. Many nations shall come and say, 'Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; He will teach us His ways, and we shall walk in His paths.' For out of Zion the law shall go forth, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem."
- Hebrews 6:19-20 (NKJV): "This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters the Presence behind the veil, where the forerunner has entered for us, even Jesus, having become High Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek."

## Observation

In Micah 4:1-2, the prophet speaks of a future time when God's kingdom will be established and exalted above all others. This vision is one of unity and peace, where many nations will seek God's wisdom and guidance. It emphasizes God's ultimate authority and the universal desire to follow His ways.

Hebrews 6:19-20 speaks of hope as an anchor for our souls, grounded in Jesus Christ who has entered God's presence on our behalf. This passage reassures us of the steadfastness and reliability of our hope in Christ, who serves as our eternal High Priest.

## Application

These scriptures remind me of the importance of seeking God's wisdom and guidance in my daily life. Just as nations will flow to God's mountain for instruction, I should continually seek His presence and teachings. Additionally, I am encouraged to hold firmly to the hope I have in Jesus, knowing that it is a secure and steadfast anchor for my soul. This means trusting Him in all circumstances and allowing His teachings to guide my actions and decisions.

## Prayer

Dear Lord,

Thank You for Your word that provides guidance and hope. Help me to seek Your wisdom daily and to walk in Your paths. I am grateful for the hope I have in Jesus, my anchor and High Priest. Strengthen my faith and help me to trust You in all things. May Your teachings shape my life and lead me closer to You.

Yours always,
Keith
