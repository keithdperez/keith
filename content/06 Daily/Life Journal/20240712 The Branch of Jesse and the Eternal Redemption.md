## Scripture

- Isaiah 11:1-2 (NKJV): "There shall come forth a Rod from the stem of Jesse, And a Branch shall grow out of his roots. The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him, The Spirit of wisdom and understanding, The Spirit of counsel and might, The Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord."
- Hebrews 9:12 (NKJV): "Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His own blood He entered the Most Holy Place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption."

## Observation

In Isaiah 11:1-2, the prophecy speaks of a future leader from the line of Jesse, who will be endowed with the Spirit of the Lord. This leader will possess wisdom, understanding, counsel, might, knowledge, and fear of the Lord. This passage points to Jesus Christ, who fulfills this prophecy as the Messiah.

Hebrews 9:12 emphasizes the significance of Jesus' sacrifice. Unlike the temporary atonement provided by animal sacrifices under the Old Covenant, Jesus' sacrifice is once for all and secures eternal redemption. This highlights the completeness and sufficiency of His work on the cross.

## Application

These scriptures remind me of the profound nature of Jesus' mission and sacrifice. I am encouraged to seek wisdom and understanding through the Holy Spirit, just as Jesus exemplified. Additionally, I am reminded to live in gratitude for the eternal redemption that Jesus has secured for me. I will strive to walk in the Spirit daily, seeking His guidance and living in a way that honors His sacrifice.

## Prayer

Dear Heavenly Father,

Thank You for sending Jesus, the Branch from Jesse, who embodies wisdom, understanding, counsel, might, knowledge, and fear of You. I am grateful for His ultimate sacrifice that has secured eternal redemption for me. Help me to live in a way that reflects this gratitude. Fill me with Your Spirit so that I may walk in wisdom and understanding every day. Guide my steps and help me to honor You in all that I do.

Yours always,
Keith
