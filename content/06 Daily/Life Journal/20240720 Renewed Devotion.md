## Scripture

- 2 Chronicles 29:3 (NKJV): "In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the Lord and repaired them."
- 2 Chronicles 30:9 (NKJV): "For if you return to the Lord, your brethren and your children will be treated with compassion by those who lead them captive, so that they may come back to this land; for the Lord your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn His face from you if you return to Him."
- James 4:8 (NKJV): "Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded."

## Observation

In 2 Chronicles, King Hezekiah's immediate action to restore the temple and call the people back to God stands out. His dedication to renewing worship and seeking God's favor is evident. The promise in 2 Chronicles 30:9 highlights God's mercy and willingness to forgive if we return to Him. Similarly, James 4:8 emphasizes the importance of drawing near to God and purifying our hearts. Both passages underscore a theme of renewal, repentance, and the assurance of God's grace.

## Application

I am reminded of the importance of prioritizing my relationship with God. Just as Hezekiah took immediate steps to restore worship, I need to take deliberate actions to draw closer to God daily. This could mean setting aside specific times for prayer, reading Scripture, or simply being more mindful of God's presence throughout my day. By doing so, I can experience His grace and mercy more fully in my life.

## Prayer

Dear Lord,

Thank You for Your endless grace and mercy. Help me to draw near to You each day and to purify my heart from anything that distracts me from Your presence. Just as King Hezekiah restored the temple, guide me in restoring and prioritizing my relationship with You. May I always seek Your face and trust in Your promise that You will draw near to me as I draw near to You.

Yours always,
Keith
