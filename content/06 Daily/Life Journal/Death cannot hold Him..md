### Jonah 1-4
5 Then the mariners were afraid; and every man cried out to his god, and threw the cargo that _was_ in the ship into the sea, to lighten the load. But Jonah had gone down into the lowest parts of the ship, had lain down, and was fast asleep.

9 So he said to them, "I _am_ a Hebrew; and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry _land._"

(Matthew 8:23-27)
23 Now when He got into a boat, His disciples followed Him. 24 And suddenly a great tempest arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves. But He was asleep. 25 Then His disciples came to _Him_ and awoke Him, saying, "Lord, save us! We are perishing!"

26 But He said to them, "Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?" Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. 27 So the men marveled, saying, "Who can this be, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?"

17 Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.

### 2 Timothy 2
11 _This is_ a faithful saying:

For if we died with _Him,_  
We shall also live with _Him._  
12 If we endure,  
We shall also reign with _Him._  
If we deny _Him,_  
He also will deny us.  
13 If we are faithless,  
He remains faithful;  
He cannot deny Himself.

## Observation

- Jonah wasn’t afraid of the storm… he was afraid of God’s call.
- Jesus also showed fear of the call.
- God prepared Jonah a place of “death” to drive him to. God drove him out.

###### Summary
The passages from Jonah and Matthew both depict storms at sea, with key figures (Jonah and Jesus) asleep in the midst of the chaos. In both instances, they are awakened and respond to the situation - Jonah by identifying himself as a Hebrew who fears God, and Jesus by calming the storm. 

In Jonah, we see a physical representation of death as he is swallowed by a large fish and remains in its belly for three days and three nights. This is reminiscent of Jesus' death and resurrection after three days.

These stories underscore God's power over nature, life, and death. The passage from Timothy further emphasizes this theme, stating that if we die with Christ, we will live with Him; if we endure hardships for His sake, we will reign with Him. The passage also reminds us of God's faithfulness - even when we are unfaithful or fearful.

In short, these passages illustrate that death cannot hold those who believe in God because He has power over death itself.



## Application

- Put aside external baggage and polish the internal man. God seeks our heart. He will be worshipped in spirit and in truth.

###### Summary
These passages remind us to have faith in God's power and sovereignty, even when we are facing storms in our own lives. Just as Jonah was delivered from the belly of the fish and Jesus calmed the storm, God can bring us through our trials. 

The passage from Timothy also encourages us to remain faithful to God, even in difficult times. We are assured that if we endure hardships for Christ's sake, we will reign with Him. 

In life and death, we should trust in God's power and faithfulness. We should remember that He conquered death through Jesus' resurrection, promising eternal life for those who believe in Him. Therefore, no matter what challenges or fears we may face, we should hold onto our faith knowing that death cannot hold those who belong to Him.

Practically speaking, this can mean turning to prayer during times of stress or fear, seeking support from fellow believers when facing trials, and continually studying scripture to strengthen our understanding of God's promises and His nature. Ultimately, it is a call to live out our faith with confidence and courage because we serve a God who holds ultimate authority over life and death.

## Prayer

God I thank you. Your name be exalted on earth and in the heavens.
Maximize your present send me minimize the noise of the world. May the words ring out, “more of You, less of me”

Love,
Keith
