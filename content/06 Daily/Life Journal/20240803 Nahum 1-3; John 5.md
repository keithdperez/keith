# The Power of God's Justice

## Scripture

- Nahum 1:7 (NKJV): "The Lord is good, A stronghold in the day of trouble; And He knows those who trust in Him."
- John 5:24 (NKJV): "Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life."

## Observation

In Nahum 1:7, the prophet Nahum speaks of God's goodness and His role as a protector for those who trust in Him. This verse stands out as a reminder of God's unwavering support and refuge in times of trouble. It emphasizes that God is not only powerful but also benevolent and caring towards those who have faith in Him.

John 5:24 highlights the promise of eternal life through belief in Jesus Christ. This verse underscores the transformative power of faith, assuring believers that they have moved from death to life and will not face judgment. It is a profound statement about the assurance and hope that comes with faith in Jesus.

## Application

To apply these insights to my life, I will focus on deepening my trust in God, especially during challenging times. I will remind myself that God is my stronghold and that He knows and cares for me. Additionally, I will hold onto the promise of eternal life through my faith in Jesus, allowing this assurance to guide my actions and decisions. By doing so, I can live with greater confidence and peace, knowing that I am under God's protection and have been granted eternal life.

## Prayer

Thank You for being my stronghold and refuge in times of trouble. Help me to trust in You more deeply and to remember Your goodness and care for me. Thank You for the promise of eternal life through faith in Jesus. May this assurance guide my actions and bring me peace. Strengthen my faith and help me to live in a way that reflects Your love and grace.

Yours always,
