## Scripture

- Micah 5:4 (NKJV): "And He shall stand and feed His flock in the strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the Lord His God; And they shall abide, for now He shall be great to the ends of the earth."
- Micah 6:8 (NKJV): "He has shown you, O man, what is good; And what does the Lord require of you but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?"
- Hebrews 7:25 (NKJV): "Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them."

## Observation

- Micah 5:4 speaks of a shepherd who will lead and care for His flock with divine strength and majesty. This shepherd will be renowned across the earth.
- Micah 6:8 distills God's requirements for us into three simple yet profound actions: justice, mercy, and humility.
- Hebrews 7:25 highlights Jesus' eternal role as our intercessor, emphasizing His ability to save completely those who approach God through Him.

## Application

- I will strive to embody the qualities of justice, mercy, and humility in my daily interactions, remembering that these are what God desires from me.
- I will take comfort in knowing that Jesus is always interceding on my behalf, which gives me confidence in my salvation and encourages me to draw closer to God.
- I will seek to lead and serve others with the strength and majesty that comes from God, aiming to reflect His greatness in all I do.

## Prayer

Dear Lord,

Thank You for Your Word today. I am grateful for the reminder that You are my shepherd, leading me with strength and majesty. Help me to live out Your requirements of justice, mercy, and humility in my life. Thank You for Jesus, who intercedes for me continually. May I always draw near to You with confidence, knowing that You are able to save me completely. Guide me to reflect Your greatness in all my actions.

Yours always,
Keith
