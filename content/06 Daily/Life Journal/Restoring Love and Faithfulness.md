# Restoring Love and Faithfulness

## Scripture

- Hosea 2:19-20 (NKJV): "I will betroth you to Me forever; Yes, I will betroth you to Me in righteousness and justice, In lovingkindness and mercy; I will betroth you to Me in faithfulness, And you shall know the Lord."
- Hebrews 2:18 (NKJV): "For in that He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to aid those who are tempted."

## Observation

In Hosea, God speaks of His unwavering commitment to His people, promising a relationship built on righteousness, justice, lovingkindness, mercy, and faithfulness. This passage highlights God's desire for an intimate and enduring relationship with us. In Hebrews, we see Jesus' empathy and support for us in our struggles. His experience with temptation makes Him a compassionate helper for us.

## Application

These scriptures remind me of the depth of God's love and commitment. I am encouraged to trust in His faithfulness and to seek a deeper relationship with Him. In my daily life, I can strive to embody the qualities of righteousness, justice, lovingkindness, and mercy in my interactions with others. Additionally, knowing that Jesus understands my struggles and is there to help me gives me strength to face challenges with confidence.

## Prayer

Dear God,

Thank You for Your unwavering love and commitment. Help me to grow in righteousness, justice, lovingkindness, and mercy. Strengthen my faith and deepen my relationship with You. Thank You, Jesus, for understanding my struggles and being my helper. Guide me through my temptations and challenges, and help me to reflect Your love in all that I do.

Yours always,
Keith
