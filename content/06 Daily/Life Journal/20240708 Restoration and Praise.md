## Scripture

- Hosea 14:4 (NKJV): "I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely, For My anger has turned away from him."
- Psalms 100:4 (NKJV): "Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, And into His courts with praise. Be thankful to Him, and bless His name."
- Hebrews 5:8 (NKJV): "Though He was a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered."

## Observation

In Hosea 14:4, God promises healing and unconditional love despite Israel's backsliding. This shows God's immense grace and willingness to restore us when we turn back to Him. Psalms 100:4 emphasizes the importance of gratitude and praise in our relationship with God. It reminds us to approach Him with a thankful heart. Hebrews 5:8 highlights that even Jesus, the Son of God, learned obedience through suffering, underscoring the value of trials in shaping our character and faith.

## Application

I will strive to remember God's promise of restoration and love, especially when I feel I've strayed from His path. I will make a conscious effort to enter His presence with gratitude and praise daily, recognizing His goodness in my life. Additionally, I will embrace challenges and sufferings as opportunities to grow in obedience and deepen my faith, following Jesus' example.

## Prayer

Dear God,

Thank You for Your promise of healing and unconditional love. Help me to always turn back to You when I stray and to trust in Your grace. I am grateful for Your constant presence in my life and for all the blessings You have given me. Teach me to approach You with a heart full of thanksgiving and praise every day. Please give me the strength to endure trials and learn obedience through them, just as Jesus did. Guide me in growing closer to You through every experience.

Yours always,
Keith
