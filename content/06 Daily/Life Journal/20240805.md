# A Heart of Renewal

## Scripture

- **2 Kings 23:25 (NKJV)**: "Now before him there was no king like him, who turned to the Lord with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the Law of Moses; nor after him did any arise like him."
- **2 Chronicles 35:18 (NKJV)**: "There had been no Passover kept in Israel like that since the days of Samuel the prophet; and none of the kings of Israel had kept such a Passover as Josiah kept, with the priests and the Levites, all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
- **John 7:37-38 (NKJV)**: "On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, 'If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.'"

## Observation

- **2 Kings 23:25**: King Josiah's dedication to God was unparalleled. His commitment was total—heart, soul, and might. This verse highlights the depth of his devotion and sets a high standard for spiritual leadership.
  
- **2 Chronicles 35:18**: The Passover celebration under Josiah was extraordinary. It was a moment of national renewal and unity, reminiscent of the days of Samuel. This underscores the power of collective worship and remembrance in drawing people closer to God.

- **John 7:37-38**: Jesus offers an invitation to all who are spiritually thirsty. His promise is profound—believers will not only be satisfied but will also become sources of life-giving water for others. This speaks to the transformative power of faith in Christ.

## Application

- **2 Kings 23:25**: I am inspired by Josiah's wholehearted devotion. I need to examine my own life and identify areas where I can turn more fully to God. Whether it's through prayer, study, or service, I want my commitment to be evident in every aspect of my life.

- **2 Chronicles 35:18**: This passage reminds me of the importance of community worship and celebration. I will make a conscious effort to participate more actively in my church's communal activities, understanding that these moments can lead to powerful spiritual renewal.

- **John 7:37-38**: Jesus' invitation is a call to deepen my faith. I will seek Him daily, trusting that He will quench my spiritual thirst and use me to bless others. I want my life to be a conduit for His love and grace, impacting those around me.

## Prayer

Father,

Thank You for the examples of Josiah and Jesus that remind me of the power of wholehearted devotion and faith. Help me to turn to You with all my heart, soul, and might. Guide me in fostering a spirit of unity and renewal within my community. May I always come to You when I am thirsty, trusting in Your promise to fill me with living water. Use me as a vessel to bring Your life-giving presence to others. 

Yours always,
