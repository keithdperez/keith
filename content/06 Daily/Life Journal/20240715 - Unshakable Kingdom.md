## Scripture

- Isaiah 22:22 (NKJV): "The key of the house of David I will lay on his shoulder; So he shall open, and no one shall shut; And he shall shut, and no one shall open."
- Hebrews 12:28 (NKJV): "Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us have grace, by which we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear."

## Observation

In Isaiah 22:22, the imagery of the key of the house of David symbolizes authority and control. It signifies that what God opens, no one can shut, and what He shuts, no one can open. This speaks to the sovereignty and ultimate authority of God over all things.

Hebrews 12:28 reminds us that we are part of an unshakeable kingdom. This is a call to gratitude and reverence, recognizing the stability and permanence of God's kingdom in contrast to the transient nature of earthly things.

## Application

I will remind myself daily that God's authority is absolute and that His plans for me are secure. When faced with uncertainty or challenges, I will remember that I am part of an unshakeable kingdom. This will help me to serve God with a heart full of gratitude and reverence, knowing that His kingdom is eternal and unmovable.

## Prayer

Dear Lord,

Thank You for Your unshakeable kingdom and for the authority You hold over all things. Help me to trust in Your plans and to remember that what You open, no one can shut, and what You shut, no one can open. Fill my heart with gratitude and reverence as I serve You each day. Guide me to live in a way that reflects Your eternal stability and grace.

Yours always,
Keith
