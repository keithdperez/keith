# DAILY NOTE
## Thursday, July 4th, 2024
***
### Journal
#### 11:45

We are once again out with family for 4th of July parade, and there seems to be an underlying issue between Julianna and I. I can’t put my finger on it, but it seems like something died or some sort of voices within our bond. It’s as though the truth settled in that things are different and now we have to adapt to the new norm. I don’t like it.

#### 7:23

Introverted. There’s a disconnect with Julianna and I. Not sure how to heal it. Everything is thrown off cause of it. Is it speculation?

#### 10:00

Still feeling awkward.
