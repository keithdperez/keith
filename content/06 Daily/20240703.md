### Journal

My wife and I are not doing well... she is upset with me. It was since being at the church. I believe she doesn’t feel like I care. Tell her my actions don't show heart. I want to resolve the issues and be close to her, but it's very hard.

I finished doing the yard, mowing and trimming the “forest” in the backyard. I’m reminded how Julianna’s workflow is WORK then REST.

Best to make the house enjoyable through hard work and tackle projects, like the yard, then enjoy the fruits of your labor.

Ive been introverted most of the evening. Being amongst the family seems to be hard for me to cut in and engage conversationally. I do enjoy being amongst their presence though. The insecurity comes from feeling like I should be different than I’m behaving.
