### Journal
#### 07:08

Just thinking of Jesus Image conference in Cali has my heart soft. Something about what they’re doing... I don’t want to leave. I want to go back. I want to be saturated in that atmosphere. I want to look at Jesus and worship like that with that heart and body of people. (YouTube)

My wife has changed. Embracing the change. Out of honeymoon phase, and into reality.
