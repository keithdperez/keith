It's easy to dismiss faith and the church, especially when you've been hurt or feel misunderstood. But for me, the church was a lifeline. It was the people of faith who supported me as I transitioned into adulthood. They were there when I chased what I believed God had for me.

The enemy of our soul has been at work long before we even begin to fight. I learned this early on. At just 3 1/2 years old, I was bullied into silence. By the age of 5, the bullying had escalated. I was beaten up and humiliated by someone I thought was my best friend. These experiences left me feeling like no one truly knew who I was. "No one knows who Keith is" became a recurring theme in my life.

Giving and receiving love has always been difficult for me. Love often comes in secret, so no one really knows what touches my heart. This way, no one can use it against me. I'm a creative at heart—I see visions and can usually sell those visions to others. I excel at finding solutions and methods for projects. I love creating things in a savvy, creative way. But my issue is that I like to make things happen myself, rather than working with others and empowering them, even though I genuinely want to.

From a young age, my mom made sure to provide and support me. We lived in Skokie, IL, and she worked six days a week. She slept on a futon in the living room so that I could have my own bedroom—a personal space where I could be myself. I played video games, practiced music, and explored anything that interested me. This space allowed my brain to dive in and create. Thanks, Mom.

I feel free when I have space alone to dive into music and projects—basically, where my mind can run free, learning, exploring, and growing in knowledge. My brain runs faster than I can communicate with words. Often, words fall short of capturing the scope of my vision, making them feel dumb and inadequate. I need help with this.

I also need help with learning how to love. My parents loved differently when I was young. My mom was nurturing and always made time for her "sweet keisito." My dad had his issues—drug abuse and life's challenges. In my later years, I see that he may have suffered from the same communication issues and ADD/distraction that I struggle with. He is a man with a good heart who didn't know how to overcome life's dealt cards. It troubled him, and now, in his later years, he has a lot to say and is trying to get his story out.

I have communication issues with my wife, especially in how we perceive communication and our intentions. When she points out something that has gone wrong or tries to show what I'm doing wrong, I listen but absorb it personally into my identity. I beat myself up over it privately, taking her words to heart. Externally, I don't say much back to absorb the high emotion in the air. She sees this as "you aren't listening" and keeps driving the point in. I keep bearing the weight of her words until it grows heavier and heavier.

In all this, I've learned that faith and the church are not the enemy. They have been my support system, helping me navigate life's challenges. The real enemy is the one who tries to isolate us, make us feel misunderstood, and keep us from giving and receiving love openly.

So to those who have abandoned their faith or are hostile to the church, consider this: sometimes, the very thing you push away might be the thing that can help you the most.
