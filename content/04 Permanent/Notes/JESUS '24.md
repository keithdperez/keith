### The Greatest Gift
> “Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing. Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails. But whether there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will vanish away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away. When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known. And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.” - ‭[I Corinthians‬ ‭13‬:‭1‬-‭13‬ ‭NKJV‬‬](https://bible.com/bible/114/1co.13.1-13.NKJV)

**6 5 4 3-5**
Beautiful, Wonderful, Glorious
Matchless in every way.

No wonder they call him beautiful
You’re beautiful.

> why do they call him beautiful? Do a study on this and give some reasoning. Give the why and then let it click. Expound on this.
#### 1 Corinthians 1
Diminishing the cross of its power…

Where selfish ambition exists, so does every vile practice with it.

If the cross of Christ doesn’t move you, that’s a scary thought. There should be something that motivates you inside. If you need me to motivate you, there’s something that should be alive inside already.

> The more you mature internally, the less you need external.

#### The psalm of ascent:
There was a journey to prep your own heart.

> Isn’t it the talent that could cloud it (the move of God)
> We’re trying to spice up the word, but in doing that we’re diluting it.
#### Luke 22:39
