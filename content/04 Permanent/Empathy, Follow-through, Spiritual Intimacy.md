Empathy, follow-through, and spiritual intimacy are three qualities that can profoundly shape our lives. They’re not just traits you’re born with; they’re skills you can develop. And like any skill, the more you practice, the better you get. Here’s how you can grow in each of these areas.

## The Empathy

Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another. It’s what makes us human. But how do you get better at it?

The first step is to listen. Really listen. Most people don’t listen; they just wait for their turn to talk. When someone is speaking, try to focus entirely on what they’re saying. Don’t think about what you’re going to say next. Just listen.

Another way to build empathy is to read fiction. Studies have shown that reading literary fiction can improve your ability to understand others’ emotions. When you read a novel, you’re essentially living another person’s life for a while. You see the world through their eyes, and that helps you understand people better in real life.

You can also practice empathy by putting yourself in situations where you have to interact with people who are different from you. Volunteer at a homeless shelter, travel to a foreign country, or just strike up a conversation with someone you wouldn’t normally talk to. The more diverse your experiences, the more empathetic you’ll become.

## Follow-Through

Follow-through is about doing what you say you’re going to do. It’s about reliability and trustworthiness. How do you get better at it?

Start small. If you make a commitment, no matter how minor, stick to it. If you tell someone you’ll call them back, call them back. If you say you’ll meet a deadline, meet it. These small acts of follow-through build up over time and create a habit of reliability.

Another tip is to write things down. It’s easy to forget commitments if they’re just floating around in your head. Use a planner or a digital calendar to keep track of your commitments. When you see them written down, they become more real and harder to ignore.

Also, learn to say no. One reason people fail to follow through is that they overcommit. They say yes to everything and then can’t deliver on all their promises. It’s better to commit to fewer things and do them well than to commit to many things and do them poorly.

## Spiritual Intimacy

Spiritual intimacy is about connecting deeply with something greater than yourself, whether that’s God, the universe, or some other form of higher power. How do you grow in spiritual intimacy?

One way is through meditation or prayer. These practices help you quiet your mind and focus on the present moment. They create a space where you can connect with your inner self and whatever higher power you believe in.

Another way is through nature. Spend time outdoors, away from the hustle and bustle of daily life. Nature has a way of putting things into perspective and helping you feel connected to something larger than yourself.

You can also grow in spiritual intimacy by studying sacred texts or philosophical works. These writings often contain wisdom that can help you understand your place in the world and your relationship with the divine.

Finally, practice gratitude. Take time each day to reflect on the things you’re grateful for. Gratitude helps you focus on the positive aspects of your life and fosters a sense of connection with something greater than yourself.

Empathy, follow-through, and spiritual intimacy are not just qualities; they’re practices. The more you work on them, the more they’ll grow. And as they grow, they’ll enrich your life in ways you can’t even imagine.
