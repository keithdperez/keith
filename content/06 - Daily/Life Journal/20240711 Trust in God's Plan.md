## Scripture

- Isaiah 8:13 (NKJV): "The Lord of hosts, Him you shall hallow; Let Him be your fear, And let Him be your dread."
- Isaiah 9:6 (NKJV): "For unto us a Child is born, Unto us a Son is given; And the government will be upon His shoulder. And His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace."
- Hebrews 8:10 (NKJV): "For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws in their mind and write them on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people."

## Observation

- Isaiah 8:13 reminds me to revere and respect God above all else. It emphasizes the importance of placing God at the center of our lives and recognizing His sovereignty.
- Isaiah 9:6 is a powerful prophecy about the coming of Jesus Christ. It highlights His divine nature and the peace He brings to the world.
- Hebrews 8:10 speaks of a new covenant where God's laws are internalized within us. It signifies a deep, personal relationship with God where He is intimately involved in our lives.

## Application

- I will strive to keep God at the forefront of my thoughts and actions, honoring Him in all that I do.
- I will reflect on the significance of Jesus' birth and His role as the Prince of Peace in my life, especially during times of turmoil.
- I will seek to internalize God's teachings, allowing them to guide my decisions and actions daily. I will embrace the personal relationship God offers through this new covenant.

## Prayer

Dear Heavenly Father,

Thank You for Your Word and the wisdom it imparts. Help me to always revere You and place You at the center of my life. Thank You for sending Your Son, Jesus Christ, to be our Wonderful Counselor and Prince of Peace. May His peace reign in my heart and life. Lord, write Your laws on my heart and mind so that I may live according to Your will. Guide my steps and help me to grow closer to You each day.

Yours always,
