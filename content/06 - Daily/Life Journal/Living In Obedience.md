# Living In Obedience

## Scripture

- 2 Kings 15:3-4 (NKJV): "And he did what was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father Amaziah had done, except that the high places were not removed; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places."
- Hosea 1:2 (NKJV): "When the Lord began to speak by Hosea, the Lord said to Hosea: 'Go, take yourself a wife of harlotry and children of harlotry, for the land has committed great harlotry by departing from the Lord.'"
- Hebrews 1:3 (NKJV): "Who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high."

## Observation

- In 2 Kings 15:3-4, we see a recurring theme where leaders do what is right in God's eyes but fail to remove high places of idol worship. This partial obedience leads to ongoing issues among the people.
- Hosea 1:2 highlights God's command to Hosea to marry a woman of harlotry as a symbolic act representing Israel's unfaithfulness. This shows God's willingness to use personal lives to convey His messages.
- Hebrews 1:3 emphasizes Jesus' divine nature and His role in purging our sins, showcasing His authority and the completeness of His work.

## Application

- From 2 Kings, I learn that partial obedience is not enough. I need to fully commit to removing any "high places" in my life—areas where I compromise or hold onto sin.
- Hosea's story reminds me that God may ask me to do difficult things to serve a greater purpose. I should be willing to obey even when it’s hard.
- Hebrews reassures me of Jesus' complete work on the cross. I can rest in His finished work and trust in His authority over all things.

## Prayer

Dear God,

Thank You for Your Word today. Help me to fully obey You and remove any high places in my life that keep me from fully serving You. Give me the courage to follow Your commands, even when they are difficult or don't make sense to me. Thank You for Jesus and His complete work on the cross. Help me to rest in His authority and trust in Your plan for my life.

Yours always,
Keith
