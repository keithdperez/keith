## Scripture

- Isaiah 5:1-2 (NKJV): "Now let me sing to my Well-beloved a song of my Beloved regarding His vineyard: My Well-beloved has a vineyard on a very fruitful hill. He dug it up and cleared out its stones, and planted it with the choicest vine. He built a tower in its midst, and also made a winepress in it; so He expected it to bring forth good grapes, but it brought forth wild grapes."
- Psalm 115:1 (NKJV): "Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to Your name give glory, because of Your mercy, because of Your truth."
- Jude 1:20-21 (NKJV): "But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life."

## Observation

- Isaiah 5:1-2 speaks of God's care and investment in His people, symbolized by the vineyard. Despite His efforts, the vineyard produced wild grapes, representing Israel's unfaithfulness.
- Psalm 115:1 reminds us that all glory belongs to God alone, emphasizing His mercy and truth.
- Jude 1:20-21 encourages believers to build their faith, pray in the Holy Spirit, and remain in God's love while awaiting Christ's mercy.

## Application

I need to recognize God's immense care and investment in my life, much like the vineyard. Despite His efforts, I sometimes produce "wild grapes" through my actions. I must strive to live faithfully and produce good fruit. Additionally, I should always give glory to God for His mercy and truth, not seeking recognition for myself. Building my faith through prayer and staying rooted in God's love will help me remain faithful and await Christ's mercy.

## Prayer

Dear Lord,

Thank You for Your unwavering care and investment in my life. Help me to produce good fruit and live faithfully according to Your will. I acknowledge that all glory belongs to You because of Your mercy and truth. Guide me to build my faith through prayer and remain rooted in Your love. As I await Your mercy, let me be a testament to Your grace.

Yours always,
Keith
