## Scripture
1 Samuel 28-29:
- David is asked to join the Philistine army, showing his loyalty to Achish, the Philistine king. Despite Achish’s approval, the Philistine commanders refuse David’s participation due to distrust.
- Saul consults the Medium at Endor, resulting in a prophecy from Samuel that seals Saul’s fate.

Psalm 109:
- David prays to God amidst accusations and seeks divine justice against those who oppress him.

Matthew 11:
- John the Baptist’s question about Jesus’ identity and Jesus’ response emphasizing the miracles confirming His role.
- Jesus discusses the greatness of John the Baptist and the Kingdom of Heaven, lamenting the unrepentance of certain towns where He performed miracles.

## Observation
In 1 Samuel 28-29, David demonstrates his readiness to step into uncertain situations despite others questioning his loyalty. In contrast, Saul’s reliance on forbidden practices, like consulting a medium, leads to tragic consequences. Psalm 109 shows David’s struggle with betrayal and opposition, emphasizing the challenges of following one’s calling. Matthew 11 illustrates Jesus’ confirmation of John the Baptist’s role and underscores the importance of divine guidance when stepping into a calling.

  

## Application
David’s example teaches us that stepping into our calling requires courage and trust in God’s timing. He faced skepticism, but his resolve remained strong. Saul’s story is a reminder to avoid shortcuts that go against God’s will, as they lead to disaster. Psalm 109 encourages us to remain faithful even when faced with criticism, using prayer to seek God’s justice and protection. Matthew 11 invites us to embrace our calling, understanding that it may involve sacrifice and challenge, but it is part of God’s greater plan.

## Prayer
Dear Lord, grant me the courage and strength to step into my calling, even when it's challenging or others doubt my path. Help me avoid shortcuts and questionable practices, focusing on Your will and guidance. Protect me from those who seek to harm or mislead me, and give me the faith to persevere through all obstacles. May I find rest in You, knowing that Your yoke is easy and Your burden is light. In Jesus' name, I pray. Amen.
