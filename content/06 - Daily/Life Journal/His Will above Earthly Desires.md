# SCRIPTURE

### 1 Kings 20:13 (NKJV)
"Suddenly a prophet approached Ahab king of Israel, saying, 'Thus says the Lord: "Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will deliver it into your hand today, and you shall know that I am the Lord."'"

### 2 Chronicles 17:3-4 (NKJV)
"Now the Lord was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the former ways of his father David; he did not seek the Baals, but sought the God of his father, and walked in His commandments and not according to the acts of Israel."

### Colossians 3:12-14 (NKJV)
"Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering; bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another; even as Christ forgave you, so you also must do. But above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfection."

# OBSERVATION

- **God's Deliverance:** In 1 Kings 20:13, God promises deliverance to King Ahab despite his previous disobedience. This shows God's mercy and His desire for people to recognize His sovereignty.

- **Faithfulness Rewarded:** 2 Chronicles 17:3-4 highlights Jehoshaphat's faithfulness to God. Unlike other kings who sought idols, Jehoshaphat followed God's commandments, and as a result, God was with him.

- **Christian Virtues:** Colossians 3:12-14 outlines the virtues that believers should embody. These include mercy, kindness, humility, meekness, patience, forgiveness, and above all, love.

- **Forgiveness:** The passage in Colossians emphasizes the importance of forgiveness, mirroring Christ's forgiveness towards us.

- **Love as Perfection:** Love is described as the bond of perfection, indicating that it is the most important virtue that holds all others together.

# APPLICATION

- **Recognize God's Sovereignty:** Just as God delivered Israel despite their shortcomings, we should recognize His sovereignty in our lives. Trust in His plans and acknowledge His power and mercy.

- **Walk in Faithfulness:** Like Jehoshaphat, strive to walk in God's commandments and avoid the distractions of modern-day idols. This means prioritizing God's will over worldly desires.

- **Embody Christian Virtues:** Make a conscious effort to embody the virtues listed in Colossians. Show mercy and kindness to others, practice humility and patience, and be quick to forgive.

- **Prioritize Love:** Above all else, prioritize love in your interactions. Let love guide your actions and decisions, as it is the bond of perfection that completes all other virtues.
