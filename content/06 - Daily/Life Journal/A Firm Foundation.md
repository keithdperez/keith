## Scripture

- Isaiah 26:3 (NKJV): "You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You."
- Hebrews 13:5-6 (NKJV): "Let your conduct be without covetousness; be content with such things as you have. For He Himself has said, 'I will never leave you nor forsake you.' So we may boldly say: 'The Lord is my helper; I will not fear. What can man do to me?'"

## Observation

In Isaiah 26:3, the promise of perfect peace is given to those who keep their minds focused on God and trust in Him. This verse emphasizes the importance of mental and spiritual focus on God as a source of peace. 

Hebrews 13:5-6 reminds us to live without covetousness and to be content with what we have, reinforcing the assurance that God will never abandon us. This passage encourages boldness and confidence in God's constant presence and help.

## Application

To apply these scriptures to my life, I need to consciously focus my mind on God throughout the day, trusting Him in all circumstances to experience His perfect peace. Additionally, I should practice contentment and gratitude for what I have, remembering that God is always with me and will never forsake me. This mindset will help me live boldly and without fear, knowing that God is my helper.

## Prayer

Dear God,

Thank You for the promise of perfect peace when I keep my mind focused on You. Help me to trust You more deeply each day and to maintain my mental and spiritual focus on Your presence. Teach me to be content with what I have and to live without covetousness, knowing that You are always with me and will never leave me. Give me the courage to live boldly and without fear, confident in Your constant help and support.

Yours always,
Keith
