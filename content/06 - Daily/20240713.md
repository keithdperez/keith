# DAILY NOTE
## Saturday, July 13th, 2024
***
## 1420/1430

- Joe created a Word Doc titled “Decks Link” on both presentation laptops. This document includes notes and links to the individual presentations. Use it to replace any slides in the Master Deck if needed.
- The Master Deck is available on Teams and has been downloaded to the machines.
- Each Block and presentation has its own section in the Master Deck for easy access and updates.

## Breaks

- I exported the deck as a looping video that will play until you advance to the next slide.

## Presenters' Videos

- All videos for presenters are set to play either on click sequence or automatically, based on their original settings.

## Equipment

- The iPad and its charger are in the lower drawer of the mixer cart.
- Joe downloaded the current slide deck for the intro and welcome remarks and left it open on the HP laptop.
- Instructions are also available in a Word Doc on the HP laptop.
- You will receive the rest of the slides by 4:30 PM, as per Jesus.

## Setup

- The confidence monitor is in place, but we can't send notes to it since our ATEM's output isn't working.
- Joe ran the piano line and electrical extension behind stage right. It is connected to the Dante 5 input channel on the QL1.
- The uplights are set up and just need to be turned on tomorrow.

Good luck, and call me if you have any questions or issues in the morning.
