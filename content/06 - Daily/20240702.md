My wife and I are not looking so good to be honest. We get in the same rut time and time again. There’s a hostility between us that comes up, especially when coming to the church. I think it’s surrounded around us leading worship… there is a pattern that has been built that has been hard to overcome. 

I constantly apologize to her, saying I’m sorry and I don’t intend to hurt her, and I usually feel like a piece of shit. I’m sorry. I usually say that I feel like we’re growing and that I want to grow from this. my intention is not to be the way that she is showing that I am, but I intend to be there for her and that I love her. I think that conflict usually pulls me into that place. I don’t usually know what to say or how to be. I try to find an answer but that leaves me stuck. I usually try to think of what to say, but it leaves me stuck.

what do I do?
