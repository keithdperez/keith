# DAILY NOTE
## Friday, July 5th, 2024
***
### Journal
#### 11:20
We were going to Costco and Home Depot - I started by saying “you down to get a scone”


#### 8:30

The day has turned around some. I fell asleep frustrated, trying to figure out how to fix everything and ended up waking up to her wanting to move on and apologizing. We played badminton in the yard together.
- find some fun things to do together.
