# Brand colors

### Northwestern Kellogg Purple

**Our primary brand color is Northwestern Purple.**

The new Northwestern Purple is a custom ink color and can no longer be referenced by a Pantone number. Designers and vendors must refer to approved color swatches (coated and ucoated paper, fabric, and plastic chips) to ensure color accuracy. To obtain a swatch packet, please contact Dana Grossman, associate director of publications and production manager, at [dgrossman@northwestern.edu](mailto:dgrossman@northwestern.edu).

  

#### COLOR CODES

Color code equivalents for Northwestern Purple are provided below. Color code choice depends on the intended output (print or digital). Using correct codes will ensure accurate color reproduction.

#### OUTPUT: PRINT

Please note that CMYK values are different for coated and uncoated paper stocks; use the appropriate codes for correct reproduction.

CMYK on coated paper: Use these color codes when printing on coated paper, which has a smooth, hard surface that minimizes ink absorption. Coated color values will reproduce poorly if printed on uncoated stock.

CMYK on uncoated paper: Use these color codes when printing on uncoated paper, which is not as smooth as coated paper and absorbs more ink.

#### OUTPUT: DIGITAL

RGB: RGB color codes should be used when creating digital materials (online graphics, social media icons, presentations to be viewed on a monitor, etc.).

Hex codes: Hex codes should be used when creating websites.

#### USAGE

_Plastic or fabric materials_

Give your vendor the appropriate color swatch to ensure that the end product will match Northwestern Purple as closely as possible.

To obtain a swatch packet, please contact Dana Grossman, associate director of publications and production manager, at [dgrossman@northwestern.edu](mailto:dgrossman@northwestern.edu).
