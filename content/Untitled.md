Hey Team,

I hope you're all doing well! I wanted to share some updates I've been working on regarding our church's online resources.

1. **New Knowledge Base:** We've created a knowledge base at [docs.thetablechurch.life](https://docs.thetablechurch.life), where you'll find various processes and guidelines for Sunday mornings and other tasks. This platform is designed to be a go-to resource for our volunteers and a collaborative space for leaders to contribute documentation on how we do things. Feel free to explore and add any documents that could help our team.

2. **Website Migration:** We've transitioned from SnapPages to Squarespace for our main website. Our new site is now live and will serve as the primary reference point for all our content. You can check out the updated site [here](#). For reference, [here's the old website](#). The new design and structure are part of the direction we're taking to improve our online presence.

I'll be sending you an email shortly with access to the new Squarespace site. This will allow you to manage and update the website as needed.

Thank you all for your continued support and contributions. Let's make these resources as helpful and accessible as possible!

Best, 
Keith
